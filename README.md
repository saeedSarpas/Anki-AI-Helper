# Anki Language Deck Generator

## Overview

This tool generates custom Anki language decks to aid in language learning. It is designed to leverage advanced GPU
capabilities to process and create decks efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the setup, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. This tool is tested with Python 3.8+.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the Anki Language Deck Generator in your local environment.

### Environment Setup

1. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**  
   This isolates the project dependencies. Run the following commands in the root directory of the project:

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows, use `.\.venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the environment.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install all required packages using the following command:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can use the tool to generate Anki decks.

TODO: Provide instructions on how to use the tool, any commands, or steps to follow after installation.

## Limitations

* **GPU Requirements**: This package is optimized for single consumer GPUs with a minimum of 24GB of VRAM. It may not
  perform as expected on GPUs with lower VRAM.
